# Contribution Guidelines

Welcome, and thank you for contributing to LootTables! Here's how you do it:

## Step #1 - What do I add?

If you don't know what to add, it's recommended to play around and find things you want to improve by experimenting.
Still clueless? Pick an issue from the [issue tracker](https://github.com/theonlytails/loottables/issues).


## Step #2 - Forking and Cloning

To [fork this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo), click on the fork button on the top right of your screen, and fork the repository.

Now that you have your own copy, make a new branch with a descriptive name (no, `new-feature` is not a descriptive name) and [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) the repository to your local environment.


## Step #3 - Write the Code

Just - do it. There's not much to detail here. Regarding code styling, stick to the [official guidelines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html) supplied by the Kotlin team. (Note: every function, property and class must have [KDocs](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/kotlin-doc.html) attached)


## Step #4 - Make a Pull Request

Once you're done coding your new feature/bugfix, come back to your fork, and make a new Pull Request from your branch to the [main branch](https://github.com/theonlytails/loottables/tree/main).

Before creating your PR, make sure to:
- Request a review from [@TheOnlyTails](https://github.com/theonlytails]
- Add a relevant label.
- If your PR is supposed to close an issue, add ["Closes #<issue number>"](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) (e.g. "Closes #3" for issue number 3) at the end of your PR message.

Now that you've created your PR, the reviewers will discuss the changes with you, and automated checks will run on your code.
**IMPORTANT:** Make sure to [enable *auto-squash and merge*](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/automatically-merging-a-pull-request#enabling-auto-merge). Once it's enabled, your PR will be automatically merged once all checks pass and reviewers approve.

## Step #5 - Celebrate

Hurray! You've made your first contribution to LootTables! 🎉
